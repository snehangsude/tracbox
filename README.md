## FAQs
1. What information are stored by TracBox?
> Only your `username` and `password` is stored. Every other detail is directly generated using the API.

2. Pixela uses a secure token - how is that used through TracBox?
> TracBox hashes your password and uses that as the token to register, create, update and delete. Hence the requirement to logging into a session.
> *(It is recommended that you **DONOT** use `Remember Me` if you are using a public machine.)*

3. I forgot my password - what shall I do now?
> Ah! We all hate that and would love to help you get that back but unfortunately Pixela doesn't allow us to reset/retrive or change a password! 
> Plus your passwords are hashed so we don't have a way to get that back (we have but it may take decades). **Best to forget the past and start new!** ðŸ˜„

4. I've mistakenly deleted my graph/account - what do I do now?
> Pretty much the above answer! Unfortunately we do not have a way to retrive it. **Note: Currently, `Delete` commands on the website doesn't pop a confirmation 
> box and would immediately remove it from the database.**

5. I'm a Patreon supporter for Pixela - why can't I use the special features?
> The website is created with the basic and the most important API calls. While it's great that you are supporting Pixela, it's yet to be integrated with
> the special features. Stay tuned for future updates!

6. I have generated a pixel but why can't I see it on the graph?
> If you have already refreshed the page and donot see it, it's cause the Pixela API puts a mark in comparison to other points. **Eg**: Say I have two dots with integer value `10` and `1`. You would initailly not be able to see a darker shade for 10 unless 1 is available as it compares value when plotting it.


## Good to know points

- Due to ease of access all forms take uppercase, camelcase and lowercase however the data is stored in lowercase
